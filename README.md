# AIChairCleaningRobot
Here is an AIRobot that I made using Java. Here is a link to a demonstration of this program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-nkZtsefcQ

  I used Java 8 for this program and I also used the becker executable jar file to get all the features of the robot.

I had so much fun implementing artificial intelligence within this project and it was so cool to witness how you can make the robot more intelligent (the robot could not only solve the problem in one scenario, but could solve the problem in a variety of scenarios).

Hope you like the project and next stop in machine learning!
